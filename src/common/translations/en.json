In particular, this website uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as your contact requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from 'http://' to 'https://' and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is therefore not possible.",
